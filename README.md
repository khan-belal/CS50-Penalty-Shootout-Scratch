# Penalty-Shootout-Scratch
Basic scratch game where player participates in a penalty shootout

# Object of the Game
You are in the world cup finals and it has come down to a penalty shoot out. 

Your objective is to score as many goals as possible against the goalie. The game will ask for your input on where to shoot the ball (either left, right, or straight).

Each time the ball goes into the net, the player will receive a point. If the goalie stops the ball, they will receive the point instead.

The game will keep going until stopped with the red stop sign.

# How to Play
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Load the PenaltyShootout.sb3 file on https://scratch.mit.edu
3. Click the green flag to start the game.

# Controls
When the whistle sounds, the game will wait for the user's input. The user will only have control of the shooter, the goalie is computer controlled.

Use the arrow keys to decide where to shoot the ball. Pressing the left key will shoot the ball left while the right key will point the ball towards the right side of the net. To shoot the ball straight, press any other key on the keyboard.
